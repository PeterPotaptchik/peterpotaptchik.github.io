I'm a DPhil student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Oxford, advised by [George Deligiannidis](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~deligian/), [Saifuddin Syed](https://www.saifsyed.com/), and [Yee Whye Teh](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh/). I'm currently based at Harvard University as a Visiting Fellow, working with [Michael Albergo](https://malbergo.me/).

My research is supported by a [Google PhD Fellowship](https://research.google/programs-and-events/phd-fellowship/recipients/), an [NSERC](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/index_eng.asp) Postgraduate Scholarship, and the [EPSRC StatML CDT](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/statistics-machine-learning).

<!-- My research centers on generative modelling and sampling, with a focus on bridging various fields. I’m particularly interested in using techniques from differential geometry, optimal transport, probability, and statistical learning theory to deepen our understanding of the strengths and limitations of algorithms in these areas. I also have a broader interest in machine learning theory. -->

Previously, I worked with [Chris J. Maddison](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~cmaddis/) and [Daniel Roy](http://danroy.org/) at the University of Toronto, where I completed my BSc in Computer Science and Statistics.
